Orbit Coordinate System
The Orbit coordinate system axes are labeled X, Y, and Z and are shown in Figure 3-2. The
primary +X axis originates from the Sun and points through the Earth to the L2 point. The +Y axis is in the ecliptic plane in the direction of the Earth orbital velocity about the sun. The +Z axis is along the resulting vector from the cross product of the +X and +Y axes (up out of page).

Observatory Coordinate System
The Observatory coordinate system axes are labeled J1, J2, and J3. This system is a right-
handed, observatory body fixed system, with its origin located at the center of the LV-to-
Observatory interface ring. The J1 and J2 axes are on the interface plane, with the J1 axis pointing in the direction of the OTE boresight. The J3 axis is perpendicular to the LV-to- Observatory interface plane, with its positive direction oriented towards the Observatory. 
The OTE coordinate system axes are labeled V1, V2, and V3. The OTE origin (0, 0, 0) is at the vertex of the nominal primary mirror surface. The OTE axes are aligned with the Observatory axes, and the OTE coordinate system origin is offset from the Observatory origin. The +V1 axis is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the primary mirror at its vertex.
V1 is the ideal optical axis and is positive toward the secondary mirror. The +V3 axis points
toward the single SMSS strut (the upper strut), such that the V1–V3 plane bisects the primary mirror (and three of its segments) along the primary mirror line of symmetry. The +V2 axis
forms a righthanded system with the V1 and V3 axes. The V1–V2 plane also bisects the primary mirror along a line of symmetry.
