- The Spacecraft and OTE combined reliability goal is 0.920.
- The Spacecraft shall be responsible for the health and safety of the Observatory.
- The Spacecraft shall be autonomously single fault tolerant against all credible failures that may result in loss of the mission.
- The design shall preclude propagation of the effects of part failures beyond the component containing the part that fails.
- Redundant functionality shall be cross-strapped, excluding primary power.
- The Observatory shall enter safe modes and reconfigure its onboard systems in response to anomalies when configured for safe mode entry.
- Safe modes shall have a least-to-greatest hierarchical impact on the mission timeline.
- All safe modes shall be designed to conserve consumables.
- The Observatory shall sustain an autonomous safe mode for 4 weeks without Ground Segment intervention.
- The Observatory shall exit safe modes via Ground Segment commands.
- While in Safe Haven mode, the Observatory shall retain recorded data while simultaneously down-linking the recorded data and real-time engineering data.
- The Observatory shall meet the interface requirements to the Launch Segment as defined in the Application to Use Ariane IRD.

**Communication Subsystem**

- Commanding shall be available on a continuous basis for 90% of 4-Pi steradian coverage.
- The Observatory shall be in continuous two-way communication from separation from the upper stage until the completion of Primary Mirror Phasing activities.
- Telemetry shall be provided to the Ground Segment from payload fairing separation until separation from the upper stage.
- The Observatory shall utilize the Deep Space Network for communication with the Ground Segment.
- Commands shall be received via low data rate channels during initial deployment and emergency communications.
- RF link margins for all links shall be at least +3dB in all operating and contingency modes.
- The Observatory shall downlink uncompressed recorded engineering data during normal operations contact.
- The onboard data processing system shall utilize the Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems protocol for downlink of stored science data and engineering telemetry.
- The Observatory shall be capable of downlinking 229 Gigabits of compressed science data from 458 Gigabits during a normal operations contact.
- The real-time downlink shall utilize the CCSDS protocol for engineering telemetry.
- The S-band link shall be used for ranging the Observatory.
- Commands shall be uplinked using COP-1 and CFDP as specified in the JWST Flight Observatory to Ground Segment IRCD.
- The command uplink shall be S-Band.
- Command uplink rates shall include 250 bps, 2 Kbps, and 16 Kbps options.
- The downlink shall be Reed-Solomon encoded and include CCSDS randomization encoding.
- The low rate downlink shall be S-Band, and the high rate downlink shall be Ka-Band with selectable rates of 7, 14, 28 Mbps.
- In backup communication mode, the Spacecraft shall receive commands via S-Band at a minimum rate of 250 bps and transmit telemetry at a minimum rate of 200 bps during safe mode.
- The Observatory shall transmit a minimum of 99.5% of all real-time telemetry and recorded data to the Ground Segment.

**Electrical Power Subsystem**

- The EPS shall provide conditioned power to the Observatory during all mission phases.
- Power shall be distributed at 28 V +7/-6 at the interface connectors.
- Circuit protection devices shall be sized to protect primary power cable wiring harnesses.
- All primary power returns shall be via hardwires to the EPS single prime power ground point.
