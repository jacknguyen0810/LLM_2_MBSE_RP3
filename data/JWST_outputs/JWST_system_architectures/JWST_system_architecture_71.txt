**Spacecraft Subsystem**

- The Spacecraft shall be available to receive commands via the low data rate channels during initial deployment and in events requiring emergency communications.
- The Spacecraft shall transmit telemetry via S-Band at a minimum rate of 200 bps during safe mode.
- The Spacecraft shall receive commands via S-Band at a minimum rate of 250 bps.
- The Spacecraft data storage capacity shall be at least 471 Gigabits of science and engineering data.
- The Spacecraft shall simultaneously store onboard science and housekeeping data during data playback.
- The Spacecraft shall be responsible for the health and safety of the Observatory.
- The Observatory shall be autonomously single fault tolerant against all credible failures that may result in loss of the mission.
- Redundant Observatory functionality shall be cross-strapped.
- The Observatory shall enter safe modes and reconfigure its onboard systems in response to anomalies when configured for safe mode entry.
- The Observatory shall exit safe modes via Ground Segment commands.
- While in Safe Haven mode the Observatory shall retain recorded data while simultaneously down-linking the recorded data and real-time engineering data to support anomaly investigation and recovery to normal operations.
- The Observatory shall meet the interface requirements to the Launch Segment defined in the Application to Use Ariane IRD.

**Optical Telescope Element (OTE) Subsystem**

- The unobscured primary mirror area shall be greater than or equal to 25 square meters.
- The OTE shall not vignette the SI FOVs including all alignment tolerances.
- The OTE WFE shall be less than or equal to 131 nm RMS over the field of views of NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI.
- The OTE WFE shall be less than or equal to 150nm RMS over the field of view of the FGS.

**Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) Subsystem**

- The ISIM mass allocation shall be 1,505 kilograms.
- The ISIM average power allocation shall be 740 watts.
- The ISIM shall compress science data using at least a 2:1 lossless science data compression averaged over one day.
- The ISIM shall bypass data compression on command.
- The ISIM shall manage the event-driven execution of the planned mission timeline.
- Excluding mechanical transients and the use of internal lamps, SI operations shall be independent of and not interfere with one another.
- The FGS shall perform fine guidance independently and without interference to any SI operations.
- All science instruments and the guider shall meet their respective image quality and spectral resolution requirements after the OTE has been adjusted to an optimal focus position.
- SIs shall not require OTE adjustment for any mode of instrument operation.
- The ISIM shall continuously monitor SI subsystems for anomalies.
- The ISIM shall place the instruments into a safe state without ground command upon detection or notification of anomalies.
- After commissioning, the ISIM shall use no more than 3,652 hours over 5 years for overhead activities which detract from prime exposure time on scientific targets.
