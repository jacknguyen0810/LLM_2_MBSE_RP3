**Spacecraft Subsystem**

- The Spacecraft shall not exceed a wet mass of 6,159 kilograms.
- The Spacecraft and OTE shall have a combined reliability goal of 0.920.
- The Spacecraft shall be responsible for the health and safety of the Observatory.
- The Spacecraft shall be autonomously single fault tolerant against all credible failures that may result in loss of the mission.
- The design of the Spacecraft shall preclude propagation of the effects of part failures beyond the component containing the part that fails.
- Redundant Spacecraft functionality shall be cross-strapped.
- The Spacecraft shall enter safe modes and reconfigure its onboard systems in response to anomalies when configured for safe mode entry.
- All safe modes shall be designed to conserve consumables.
- The Spacecraft shall sustain an autonomous safe mode for 4 weeks without Ground Segment intervention.
- The Spacecraft shall exit safe modes via Ground Segment commands.
- While in Safe Haven mode the Spacecraft shall retain recorded data while simultaneously down-linking the recorded data and real-time engineering data to support anomaly investigation and recovery to normal operations.

**Communication Subsystem**

- The Observatory shall be designed to ensure that commanding is available on a continuous basis for 90% of 4-Pi steradian coverage.
- The Observatory shall be in continuous two-way communication with the Ground Segment from separation from the upper stage of the launch vehicle until the completion of Observatory Primary Mirror Phasing activities.
- The Observatory shall provide telemetry to the Ground Segment from launch vehicle payload fairing separation until separation from the upper stage of the launch vehicle.
- The Observatory shall utilize the Deep Space Network to communicate with the Ground Segment.
- The Spacecraft shall be available to receive commands via the low data rate channels during initial deployment and in events requiring emergency communications.
- Radio frequency link margins for all links shall be at least +3dB in all operating and contingency modes.
- During a normal operations contact, the Observatory shall downlink the uncompressed recorded engineering data.
- The onboard data processing system shall utilize the Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems protocol for downlink of stored science data and engineering telemetry.
- During a normal operations contact, the Observatory shall be capable of downlinking to the Ground Segment 229 Gigabits of science data, which was compressed from 458 Gigabits.
- The onboard data processing system shall utilize the CCSDS protocol for real-time downlink of engineering telemetry.
- The S-band link shall be used for ranging the Observatory.

**Electrical Power Subsystem**

- The Electrical Power Subsystem shall provide conditioned power to the Observatory during all mission phases.
- The EPS shall distribute direct current power to the loads at 28 V +7/-6 at the interface connectors.
- Circuit protection devices shall be sized to protect primary power cable wiring harnesses.
- All primary power returns shall be via hardwires to the EPS single prime power ground point.

**Thermal Subsystem**

- The thermal control system shall regulate the temperatures and rates of temperature changes of the JWST Observatory within safe and operational limits for all mission phases.
- The Observatory architecture shall allow for the passive cooling of ISIM-related components and electronics to their safe and operational limits.
- The Observatory shall passively cool the Near-Infrared Science Detectors to a temperature of less than or equal to 37K beginning at a time during commissioning that supports NIRCam and NIRSpec commissioning and continuing until the end of the science mission lifetime.

**Propellant Lifetime**

- Propellant shall be sized for 10 years of operation after launch.

**Launch Vehicle Interface**

- The JWST Observatory shall meet the interface requirements to the Launch Segment defined in the Application to Use Ariane IRD.
