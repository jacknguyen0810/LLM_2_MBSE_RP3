- The JWST Observatory is composed of the Spacecraft, Optical Telescope Element (OTE), and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM).
**Spacecraft**

- The Spacecraft and OTE shall have a combined reliability goal of 0.920.
- The Spacecraft shall be available to receive commands via the low data rate channels during initial deployment and in events requiring emergency communications.
- The Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS) shall provide conditioned power to the Observatory during all mission phases.
- The EPS shall distribute direct current power to the loads at 28 V +7/-6 at the interface connectors.
- All primary power returns shall be via hardwires to the EPS single prime power ground point.
- The Spacecraft shall be responsible for the health and safety of the Observatory.
- The Observatory shall be autonomously single fault tolerant against all credible failures that may result in loss of the mission.
- Redundant Observatory functionality shall be cross-strapped.
- The Observatory shall enter safe modes and reconfigure its onboard systems in response to anomalies when configured for safe mode entry.
- The JWST Observatory shall meet the interface requirements to the Launch Segment defined in the Application to Use Ariane (DUA) IRD.

**Optical Telescope Element (OTE)**

- The unobscured primary mirror area shall be greater than or equal to 25 square meters.
- The OTE shall not vignette the SI FOVs including all alignment tolerances.
- The OTE WFE shall be less than or equal to 131 nm RMS over the field of views of NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI.
- The OTE optics, mounts, and baffles shall not obstruct properly focused light from reaching the science focal planes.

**Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM)**

- The ISIM mass allocation shall be 1,505 kilograms.
- The ISIM average power allocation shall be 740 watts.
- The SIs and guiders allocated field of views shall be greater than or equal to the values shown in the table below.
- The SIs and guiders FOVs shall be arranged in a non-overlapping fashion within the OTE FOV.
- The ISIM shall contain a camera that provides the imagery required to support wavefront sensing.
- Pupil Imaging shall be performed in the wavefront sensor.
- When commanded, the ISIM shall compress science data using at least a 2:1 lossless science data compression averaged over one day.
- The ISIM shall bypass data compression on command.
- The ISIM shall manage the event-driven execution of the planned mission timeline.
- Excluding mechanical transients and the use of internal lamps, SI operations shall be independent of and not interfere with one another.
- The FGS shall perform fine guidance independently and without interference to any SI operations.
- All science instruments and the guider shall meet their respective image quality and spectral resolution requirements after the OTE has been adjusted to an optimal focus position.
- SIs shall not require OTE adjustment for any mode of instrument operation.
- The ISIM shall continuously monitor SI subsystems for anomalies.
- The ISIM shall place the instruments into a safe state without ground command upon detection or notification of anomalies.
