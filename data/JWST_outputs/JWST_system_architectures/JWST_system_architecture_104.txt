**Spacecraft Subsystem**

- The Spacecraft shall be available to receive commands via the low data rate channels during initial deployment and in events requiring emergency communications.
- The Spacecraft shall transmit telemetry via S-Band at a minimum rate of 200 bps during safe mode.
- The Spacecraft shall receive commands via S-Band at a minimum rate of 250 bps.
- The Electrical Power Subsystem shall provide conditioned power to the Observatory during all mission phases.
- The EPS shall distribute direct current power to the loads at 28 V +7/-6 at the interface connectors.
- Circuit protection devices shall be sized to protect primary power cable wiring harnesses.
- All primary power returns shall be via hardwires to the EPS single prime power ground point.
- The Spacecraft shall be responsible for the health and safety of the Observatory.
- The Observatory shall be autonomously single fault tolerant against all credible failures that may result in loss of the mission.
- The design of the Observatory shall preclude propagation of the effects of part failures beyond the component containing the part that fails.
- Redundant Observatory functionality shall be cross-strapped.
- The Observatory shall enter safe modes and reconfigure its onboard systems in response to anomalies when configured for safe mode entry.
- All safe modes shall be designed to conserve consumables.
- The Observatory shall sustain an autonomous safe mode for 4 weeks without Ground Segment intervention.
- The Observatory shall exit safe modes via Ground Segment commands.
- While in Safe Haven mode the Observatory shall retain recorded data while simultaneously down-linking the recorded data and real-time engineering data to support anomaly investigation and recovery to normal operations.
- The JWST Observatory shall meet the interface requirements to the Launch Segment.

**Integrated Science Instrument Module**

- The ISIM mass allocation shall be 1,505 kilograms.
- The ISIM average power allocation shall be 740 watts.
- The SIs and guiders allocated field of views shall be greater than or equal to the values shown in the table.
- The SIs and guiders FOVs shall be arranged in a non-overlapping fashion within the OTE FOV.
- The Observatory shall provide imagery with spectral resolution in the range of 3 < R < 200 over a wavelength range of 0.6 - 27 µm.
- The Observatory shall provide spectroscopy with spectral resolution in the range of 50 < R < 5000 over a wavelength range of 0.6 - 27 µm.
- The ISIM shall contain a camera that provides the imagery required to support wavefront sensing.
- Pupil Imaging shall be performed in the wavefront sensor.
- When commanded, the ISIM shall compress science data using at least a 2:1 lossless science data compression averaged over one day.
- The ISIM shall bypass data compression on command.
- The ISIM shall manage the event-driven execution of the planned mission timeline.
- Excluding mechanical transients and the use of internal lamps, SI operations shall be independent of and not interfere with one another.
- The FGS shall perform fine guidance independently and without interference to any SI operations.
- All science instruments and the guider shall meet their respective image quality and spectral resolution requirements after the OTE has been adjusted to an optimal focus position.
- SIs shall not require OTE adjustment for any mode of instrument operation.
- The ISIM shall continuously monitor SI subsystems for anomalies.
- The ISIM shall place the instruments into a safe state without ground command upon detection or notification of anomalies.
- After commissioning, the ISIM shall use no more than 3,652 hours over 5 years for overhead activities which detract from prime exposure time on scientific targets.
