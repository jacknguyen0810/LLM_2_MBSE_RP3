Based on the provided mission requirements, the following set of system functions can be defined:

1. **Observation Pass Management:**
   - Subfunction 1: Execute primary observation pass with multiple IR and VIS images of the primary target.
   - Subfunction 2: Execute secondary observation pass with IR images of secondary targets.
   - Subfunction 3: Execute tertiary observation pass with multiple VIS images of the tertiary target.
   - Subfunction 4: Distribute images over the observation window to provide varied viewing angles.

2. **Observation Automation:**
   - Subfunction 1: Automate observations based on a pre-determined schedule for standard targets.
   - Subfunction 2: Allow uplinking priority observation scenarios.

3. **Observation Constraints:**
