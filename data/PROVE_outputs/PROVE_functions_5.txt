Certainly! Here's a rephrased version without the function numbers:

1. **Primary Target Observation Pass:**
   - Acquire multiple Infrared (IR) images of the primary target.
   - Acquire multiple Visible (VIS) images of the primary target.
   - Distribute IR and VIS images over the observation window for a range of viewing angles.

2. **Secondary Target Observation Pass:**
   - Acquire IR images of given secondary targets.
   - Perform secondary observation pass for specified targets.

3. **Tertiary Target Observation Pass:**
   - Acquire multiple VIS images of the tertiary target.
   - Perform tertiary observation pass for specified target.

4. **Automated Observations:**
   - Automate observations based on a predetermined schedule for standard targets.
   - Allow uplinking of priority observation scenarios.

5. **Observation Parameters:**
   - Set minimum elevation angle for target observations at 30 degrees.
   - Maintain payload structure alignment within 12Â° FOV.

6. **Science Observations:**
   - Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for science observations.
   - Ensure minimum swath width of 80km at nadir for scientific images.

7. **Spatial Sampling Distance (SSD) and Image Goals:**
   - Provide IR images with SSD at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m.
   - Provide narrow-angle VIS images with SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m.
   - Provide a minimum of 10 science images, with a goal of 50, per primary or tertiary observation pass.

8. **Temporal Resolution:**
   - Achieve a temporal resolution for primary target observations of a minimum of 16 days, with a goal of 5 days.

9. **Camera Specifications:**
   - Ensure the NedT of the IR camera is a minimum of 0.5K with a goal of 0.05 K.
   - Implement an uncooled IR camera.

10. **Calibration and Geolocation:**
    - Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera a minimum of once per target.
    - Provide geolocation of the target to within one SSD over land.

11. **Pointing Accuracy:**
    - Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
    - Achieve a pointing knowledge of 0.1 degrees.

12. **Data Handling and Downlink:**
    - Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days.
    - Size onboard storage for a threshold of one primary target image set, with a goal of 10 primary target image sets.
    - Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.

13. **Payload Constraints:**
    - Ensure the total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg.
    - Ensure the total payload power usage does not exceed 14W.
    - Ensure the total payload volume does not exceed 2U.

14. **Mission Modes:**
    - Implement imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes as needed.

15. **Hardware Qualification:**
    - Qualify mission hardware to the levels and durations specified in GSFC-STD-7000B.
