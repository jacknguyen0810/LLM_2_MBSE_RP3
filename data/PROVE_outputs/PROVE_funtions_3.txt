Based on the provided mission requirements, the following system functions can be identified:

1. **Observation Pass Functions:**
   - **Primary Observation Pass:**
     - Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a given primary target.
     - Distribute images over the observation window for a range of viewing angles.
     - Perform MIS-001 for a threshold lifetime of 1 month, with a goal of 12 months.
     - Achieve a temporal resolution of a minimum of 16 days, with a goal of 5 days.
     - Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree (To Be Confirmed - TBC).
     - Achieve a pointing knowledge of 0.1 degrees (TBC).
   - **Secondary Observation Pass:**
     - Provide IR images of given secondary targets.
     - Perform a minimum of 1 science image per target.
   - **Tertiary Observation Pass:**
     - Provide multiple VIS images of a given tertiary target.
     - Achieve a minimum swath width for scientific VIS images of 80km at nadir.

2. **Imaging Functions:**
   - Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for science observations.
   - Maintain alignment of the imager field of views to within 12Â°.
   - Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m.
   - Provide narrow-angle VIS images with a SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m.
   - Provide a minimum of 10 science images, with a goal of 50, per primary or tertiary observation pass.
   - The NedT of the IR camera shall be a minimum of 0.5K, with a goal of 0.05K.
   - Radiometric calibration of the IR camera shall be performed a minimum of once per target.

3. **Automated Observation Functions:**
   - Automate observations based on a pre-determined observation schedule of standard targets.
   - Allow for uplinking priority observation scenarios.

4. **Technical Specifications Functions:**
   - Achieve a minimum elevation angle for observations of targets of 30 degrees.
   - Provide the geolocation of the target to within one SSD over land (TBC).
   - Achieve a total payload mass not exceeding 2.66kg.
   - Achieve a total payload power usage not exceeding 14W.
   - Achieve a total payload volume not exceeding 2U.

5. **Data Handling and Downlink Functions:**
   - Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days.
   - Onboard storage sized for a threshold of one primary target image set, with a goal of 10 primary target image sets.
   - Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.

6. **Mission Modes and Hardware Qualification Functions:**
   - Implement modes: imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes as needed.
   - Qualify mission hardware to the levels and durations specified in GSFC-STD-7000B.
