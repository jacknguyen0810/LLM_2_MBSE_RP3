SYSTEM FUNCTIONS:
- Provide multiple infrared (IR) and visible spectrum (VIS) images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles for both IR and VIS images.
- Perform primary target observations for a threshold lifetime of 1 month, with a goal of 12 months.
- Automatically conduct observations based on a pre-determined schedule of standard targets and allow for priority observation scenarios to be uploaded.
- Ensure a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for scientific observations.
- Maintain alignment of imager field of views to within 12 degrees.
- Provide IR images with specified spatial sampling distances (300m threshold, 90m goal) and VIS images with specified spatial sampling distances (50m threshold, 15m goal) at nadir.
- Capture a minimum of 10 science images, with a goal of 50, per primary or tertiary observation pass.
- Capture at least 1 science image per target during secondary observation passes.
- Achieve a temporal resolution of 16 days for primary target observations with a goal of 5 days.
- Ensure the IR camera has a Noise Equivalent Temperature difference (NedT) of at least 0.5K with a goal of 0.05K, and that it is uncooled.
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target, ideally before image capture.
- Provide geolocation accuracy of the target within one spatial sampling distance over land.
- Achieve pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
- Downlink image data within prescribed timeframes (1 month threshold, 7 days goal), with onboard storage capabilities for specific image sets (threshold: 1 set, goal: 10 sets).
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage as needed.
- Ensure the total payload mass, power usage, and volume do not exceed specified limits.
- Include operational modes such as imaging, standby, safe, and other non-nominal modes.
- Qualify mission hardware to GSFC-STD-7000B standards for levels and durations.
