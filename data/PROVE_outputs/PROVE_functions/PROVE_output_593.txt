- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a given primary target during a single primary observation pass
- Provide IR images of given secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass
- Provide multiple VIS images of a given tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass
- Distribute images over the observation window in MIS-001 and MIS-003 to provide a range of viewing angles

- Maintain imager field of views alignment within 12 degrees
- Provide IR images with SSD at nadir of 300m (threshold) and 90m (goal)
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold) and 15m (goal)
- Provide a minimum of 10 science images (goal of 50) per primary or tertiary observation pass
- Provide a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass
- Achieve a temporal resolution for primary target observations of a minimum of 16 days (goal of 5 days)
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target, ideally before target capture begins
- Provide geolocation of the target within one SSD over land
- Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree
- Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month (goal of 7 days)
- Size onboard storage for one primary target image set (MIS-012), with a goal of 10 sets
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage
- Ensure total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg
- Ensure total payload power usage does not exceed 14W
- Ensure total payload volume does not exceed 2U
- Include imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes
- Qualify mission hardware to GSFC-STD-7000B levels and durations

These system functions encompass the requirements from mission, electrical, software, structural, and thermal aspects of the system design.
