Certainly! Here is the set of system functions without the numbering:

**Primary Target Observation Pass:**
   - Acquire and provide multiple Infrared (IR) images of the primary target during a single observation pass.
   - Acquire and provide multiple Visible (VIS) images of the primary target during a single observation pass.
   - Distribute images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles.

**Secondary Target Observation Pass:**
   - Acquire and provide IR images of given secondary targets during a single observation pass.

**Tertiary Target Observation Pass:**
   - Acquire and provide multiple VIS images of a given tertiary target during a single observation pass.

**Observation Scheduling:**
   - Perform automated observations based on a predetermined schedule for standard targets.
   - Allow uplinking of priority observation scenarios.

**Observation Parameters:**
   - Enforce a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
   - Ensure alignment of imager field of views within 12Â°.

**Science Observations:**
   - Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for scientific observations.
   - Maintain a minimum swath width of 80km at nadir for scientific images.

**Spatial Sampling Distance (SSD) Requirements:**
   - Provide IR images with an SSD at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m.
   - Provide narrow-angle VIS images with an SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m.

**Science Image Goals:**
   - Provide a minimum of 10 science images, with a goal of 50, per primary or tertiary observation pass.
   - Provide a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass.

**Temporal Resolution:**
   - Achieve a temporal resolution for primary target observations of a minimum of 16 days, with a goal of 5 days.

**Infrared Camera Requirements:**
   - Ensure the NedT of the IR camera is a minimum of 0.5K with a goal of 0.05 K.
   - Use an uncooled IR camera.
   - Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera a minimum of once per target (ideally before target capture begins).

**Geolocation and Pointing:**
   - Provide geolocation of the target to within one SSD over land.
   - Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
   - Achieve a pointing knowledge of 0.1 degrees.

**Data Handling and Downlink:**
   - Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days.
   - Size onboard storage for a threshold of one primary target image set, with a goal of 10 primary target image sets.
   - Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.

**Payload Constraints:**
   - Ensure total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg.
   - Ensure total payload power usage does not exceed 14W.
   - Ensure total payload volume does not exceed 2U.

**Mission Modes:**
   - Implement imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes as needed.

**Hardware Qualification:**
   - Qualify mission hardware to the levels and durations specified in GSFC-STD-7000B.
