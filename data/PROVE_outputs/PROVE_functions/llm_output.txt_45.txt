SYSTEM FUNCTIONS:

- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute images over the observation window for a range of viewing angles.
- Perform observations based on a pre-determined schedule with the ability to prioritize observations.
- Ensure a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for science observations.
- Maintain alignment of imager field of views to within 12 degrees.
- Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m.
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with a SSD at nadir of 50m.
- Capture a minimum of 10 science images per primary or tertiary observation pass.
- Capture a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass.
- Achieve temporal resolution for primary target observations.
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera before target capture.
- Provide geolocation of the target to within one SSD over land.
- Achieve pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
- Downlink image data within specified timeframes.
- Size onboard storage for image sets based on requirements.
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.
- Ensure total payload mass, power usage, and volume do not exceed specified limits.
- Operate in different modes including imaging, standby, safe, and other non-nominal modes.
- Interface with and monitor health of electrical subsystem components.
- Interface with IR and VIS cameras for data transmission and commands.
- Determine spacecraft position and attitude at image capture moments.
- Monitor and switch power to camera modules based on health conditions.
- Store imaging data, health telemetry, and commands as required.
- Accommodate different imaging modes and sequences for IR and VIS cameras.
- Operate in specific temperature ranges and environmental conditions.
- Ensure structural integrity to support payload components and fit within specified volume.
- Ensure thermal ratings and limits for all payload components.
