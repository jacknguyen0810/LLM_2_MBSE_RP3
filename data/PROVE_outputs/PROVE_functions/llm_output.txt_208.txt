**System Functions:**

- Provide multiple Infrared (IR) and Visible (VIS) images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute IR and VIS images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles.
- Perform observations automatically based on a pre-determined schedule with the ability to prioritize certain scenarios.
- Ensure minimum elevation angle for target observations is 30 degrees.
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for scientific observations.
- Maintain imager field of views alignment within 12 degrees.
- Provide IR images with spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m.
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m.
- Capture a minimum of 10 science images per primary or tertiary observation pass.
- Provide a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass.
- Achieve a temporal resolution for primary target observations of a minimum of 16 days, with a goal of 5 days.
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target, ideally before target capture.
- Provide target geolocation within one SSD over land.
- Achieve pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
- Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days.
- Size onboard storage for at least one primary target image set, with a goal of 10 sets.
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.
- Ensure total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg.
- Ensure total payload power usage does not exceed 14W.
- Ensure total payload volume does not exceed 2U.
- Implement operation modes including imaging, standby, safe, and other non-nominal modes as needed.
- Qualify mission hardware to the levels and durations specified in GSFC-STD-7000B.
