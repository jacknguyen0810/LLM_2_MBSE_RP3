**System Functions:**

- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles for primary and tertiary targets.
- Perform observations based on a predetermined schedule and capability to prioritize observation scenarios.
- Maintain a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for scientific observations.
- Ensure a minimum swath width of 80km at nadir for scientific images.
- Maintain alignment of imager field of views within 12 degrees.
- Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) of 300m at nadir.
- Provide VIS images with an SSD of 50m at nadir.
- Deliver a minimum of 10 science images per primary or tertiary observation pass.
- Offer a minimum of 1 science image per target during a secondary observation pass.
- Ensure a temporal resolution of at least 16 days for primary target observations.
- Achieve a NedT of the IR camera of 0.5K.
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target.
- Provide target geolocation within one SSD over land.
- Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
- Downlink image data within a maximum of 1 month after capture.
- Design onboard storage for a minimum of one primary target image set, expandable up to 10 sets.
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.
- Ensure the total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg.
- Restrict total payload power usage to a maximum of 14W.
- Limit total payload volume to 2U.
- Implement operational modes including imaging, standby, safe, and other non-nominal modes.
- Qualify mission hardware to GSFC-STD-7000B standards.
