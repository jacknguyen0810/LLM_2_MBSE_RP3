SYSTEM FUNCTIONS:

- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a primary target during a single observation pass
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single observation pass
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single observation pass
- Distribute images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles
- Perform observations based on a pre-determined schedule with the ability to prioritize scenarios
- Ensure a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for science observations
- Maintain alignment of the imager field of views within 12 degrees
- Provide IR images with spatial sampling distance at nadir of 300m (threshold)
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with spatial sampling distance at nadir of 50m (threshold)
- Provide a minimum number of science images per observation pass for primary, secondary, and tertiary targets
- Achieve a temporal resolution for primary target observations
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera before target capture
- Provide geolocation accuracy of the target within one spatial sampling distance over land
- Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree
- Downlink image data within a specified timeframe
- Size onboard storage for a specific number of primary target image sets
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage
- Ensure the total payload mass, power usage, and volume do not exceed specified limits
- Have operational modes including imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes
- Interface with FLIR Tau2 IR camera and Basler acA640-100gm camera for commanding and streaming images
- Determine spacecraft position and attitude at the moment of image capture
- Monitor health of payload components, temperature, and power consumption
- Provide electrical connections for data interfaces between components
