**System Functions:**

- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles for primary and tertiary targets.
- Perform primary target observations for a threshold lifetime of 1 month, with a goal of 12 months.
- Automate observations based on a pre-determined schedule with the ability to uplink priority scenarios.
- Ensure a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
