System Functions:
- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a given primary target during a single primary observation pass
- Provide IR images of given secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass
- Provide multiple VIS images of a given tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass
- Distribute images over the observation window for MIS-001 and MIS-003 to provide a range of viewing angles
- Perform MIS-001 for a threshold lifetime of 1 month, with a goal of 12 months
- Automate observations based on a pre-determined schedule with the ability to uplink priority scenarios
- Maintain a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for science observations
- Maintain alignment of imager field of views within 12 degrees
- Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with a SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m
- Provide a minimum of 10 science images per primary or tertiary observation pass
- Provide a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass
- Achieve a temporal resolution for primary target observations of a minimum of 16 days, with a goal of 5 days
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target
- Provide geolocation of the target to within one SSD over land
- Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree
- Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days
- Size onboard storage for at least one primary target image set, with a goal of 10 sets
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage
- Ensure the total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg
- Ensure the total payload power usage does not exceed 14W
- Ensure the total payload volume does not exceed 2U
- Support different operational modes including imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes as needed
- Interface with the FLIR Tau2 IR camera and Basler acA640-100gm camera for data streaming and command sending
- Monitor the health and power consumption of payload components
- Provide sufficient power via 12V, 5V, and 3V buses for components
- Cut power to cameras triggered by the payload computer or autonomously via health monitoring sensors
- Provide electrical connections to support data interfaces between components and the payload computer
- Interface with the CubeSat bus and tolerate overrides, routing connections through a Harwin Gecko connector
- Store imaging data, position data, health telemetry, and commands as needed
- Operate in different modes including imaging sequence passes, single image passes, and standby mode
- Operate within specified temperature ranges and environmental conditions
- Ensure the structural integrity of the payload structure to support components and maintain alignment
- Ensure all payload components are rated to withstand expected temperature ranges and have specified operating/storage temperature limits
