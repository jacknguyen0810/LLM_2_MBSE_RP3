- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a given primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of given secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a given tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute images over the observation window in MIS-001 and MIS-003 to provide a range of viewing angles.
- Perform observations automatically based on a preset schedule and allow for uplinking priority scenarios.
- Maintain a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
- Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for scientific observations.
- Ensure a minimum swath width of 80km at nadir for scientific images.
- Maintain alignment of imager field of views within 12 degrees.
- Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m (threshold) and 90m (goal).
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with a SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold) and 15m (goal).
- Capture a minimum of 10 science images per primary or tertiary observation pass.
- Capture a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass.
- Maintain a temporal resolution for primary target observations of 16 days (minimum) and 5 days (goal).
- Ensure the NedT of the IR camera is a minimum of 0.5K with a goal of 0.05K.
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera a minimum of once per target, ideally before target capture begins.
- Provide geolocation of target to within one SSD over land.
- Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
- Downlink image data within 1 month (threshold) and 7 days (goal) of capture.
- Provide sufficient onboard storage for at least one primary target image set (MIS-012), with a goal of 10 sets.
- Transfer data between components for downlinking or additional storage.

These system functions cover the mission, electrical, software, structural, and thermal requirements for the complex system design.
