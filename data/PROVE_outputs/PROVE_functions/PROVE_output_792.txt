**System Functions:**

- Provide multiple IR and VIS images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
- Provide IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
- Provide multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
- Distribute IR and VIS images over the observation window to provide a range of viewing angles.
- Perform observations based on a pre-determined schedule of standard targets and accommodate priority observation scenarios.
- Ensure a minimum observation elevation angle of 30 degrees.
- Capture narrow-angle IR and VIS images for science observations.
- Maintain alignment of imager field of views within 12 degrees.
- Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m.
- Provide narrow-angle VIS images with a SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m.
- Capture a minimum of 10 science images, with a goal of 50, per primary or tertiary observation pass.
- Capture a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass.
- Ensure a temporal resolution of a minimum of 16 days, with a goal of 5 days, for primary target observations.
- Achieve a NedT of the IR camera of a minimum of 0.5K, with a goal of 0.05K.
- Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target, ideally before target capture begins.
- Provide geolocation of the target to within one SSD over land.
- Achieve a pointing accuracy of 1 degree.
- Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days.
- Provide onboard storage for a threshold of one primary target image set, with a goal of 10 primary target image sets.
- Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.
- Ensure the total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg.
- Ensure the total payload power usage does not exceed 14W.
- Ensure the total payload volume does not exceed 2U.
- Support operation in imaging, standby, safe, and other TBD non-nominal modes.
- Interface with the FLIR Tau2 IR camera for CDH operations.
- Stream images from the Tau2 and Basler cameras per primary observation pass.
- Determine spacecraft position and attitude at the moment of image capture with specified accuracy.
- Monitor the health of payload components and switch power to cameras as needed.
- Provide electrical connections for data interfaces between various payload components and the bus.
- Store imaging data, position data, and health telemetry as per specified requirements.
- Operate in different modes and switch between modes automatically as required.
- Ensure the CDH subsystem can operate within specified temperature ranges and environmental conditions.
- Ensure structural requirements for payload support and alignment of imager swaths are met.
- Ensure thermal requirements for payload components are maintained throughout the mission.
