1. **Imaging Functions**:
   - Capture multiple IR and VIS images of a primary target during a single primary observation pass.
   - Capture IR images of secondary targets during a single secondary observation pass.
   - Capture multiple VIS images of a tertiary target during a single tertiary observation pass.
   - Distribute images over the observation window for MIS-001 and MIS-003, providing various viewing angles.
   - Perform automated observations based on a pre-determined schedule for standard targets and allow uplinking priority observation scenarios.

2. **Observation Parameters**:
   - Maintain a minimum elevation angle of 30 degrees for target observations.
   - Provide narrow-angle IR and VIS images for scientific observations.
   - Ensure a minimum swath width of 80km at nadir for scientific images.
   - Maintain alignment of imager field of views within 12Â°.

3. **Image Specifications**:
   - Provide IR images with a spatial sampling distance (SSD) at nadir of 300m (threshold), with a goal of 90m.
   - Provide narrow-angle VIS images with an SSD at nadir of 50m (threshold), with a goal of 15m.
   - Offer a minimum of 10 to a goal of 50 science images per primary or tertiary observation pass.
   - Provide a minimum of 1 science image per target per secondary observation pass.

4. **Temporal and Technical Specifications**:
   - Maintain a temporal resolution of a minimum of 16 days to a goal of 5 days for primary target observations.
   - Ensure the IR camera's NedT (Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference) meets a minimum of 0.5K with a goal of 0.05K and is uncooled.
   - Perform radiometric calibration of the IR camera at least once per target, preferably before target capture.
   - Achieve geolocation of the target within one SSD over land.
   - Achieve pointing accuracy of 1 degree and pointing knowledge of 0.1 degrees.

5. **Data Handling and Transfer**:
   - Downlink image data within a threshold of 1 month, with a goal of 7 days.
   - Size onboard storage for at least one primary target image set (MIS-012), with a goal of 10 primary target image sets.
   - Transfer data to the bus for downlink or additional storage.

6. **Payload and System Constraints**:
   - Ensure the total payload mass does not exceed 2.66kg.
   - Ensure the total payload power usage does not exceed 14W.
   - Ensure the total payload volume does not exceed 2U.

7. **Operational Modes and Qualifications**:
   - Include imaging, standby, safe modes, and other non-nominal modes as needed.
   - Qualify mission hardware to the levels and durations specified in GSFC-STD-7000B.
